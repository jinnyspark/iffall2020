    Is it true?<br>
    You've been feeling sort of low these days<br>
    Just don't have a place to go these days<br>
    Must be bringing you down</p>

    <br>

    <p>
    If it's so<br>
    Then come on give this lover boy a try<br>
    I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes<br>
    What could you lose? </p>

    <br>

    <p>
    Well for one, her heart belongs to another<br> 
    And no other heart will do </p>

    <br>
    <p>
    Is it wrong, to think my love could really help you out?<br>
    It's simply just my stubborn heart no doubt, rambling away<br>
    If it's not </p>

    <br>

    <p>
    Then come on give this lover boy a try<br>
    I'll put the sparkle right back in your eyes<br>
    What could you lose?</p>

    <br>

    <p>
    Well for one, her heart belongs to another<br>
    And no other heart will do<br>
    For one, her heart belongs to another<br>
    And no other heart will do</p>
